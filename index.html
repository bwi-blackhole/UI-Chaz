                            <p>Sometimes, you just need to vent to get it out, move on, and feel better.  Enter black hole. The reverse note taking app where everything you 
                            type automatically gets dumped in the trash. Research shows writing things down helps your brain move past the thought and onto bigger and brighter things. 
                            Don't let the fear of other people reading what you write stop you from reaping these benefits! Driver cut you off? Frustrated with 
                            the hour long wait time at a restaurant? Type out your response, hit submit, and it's absorbed into the black hole so you can move on with your life. </p>

                            <h4>Theory Behind The Process</h4>
                            <p> We all have unwanted thoughts from time to time. They often pop up when they are least wanted — mental chatter that takes us away from the 
                                present moment. People on a diet start thinking about all the things they hate about their body or, in an important business meeting, 
                                we worry about whether we are making a good impression on others instead of listening to what a potential client is saying. 
                                It seems impossible to rid our minds of these unwanted thoughts — especially when they are of the negative variety. 
                                What can we do to quiet our minds? </p>

                            <h4>What Does The Research Say?</h4>
                            <p>Several decades of psychological research show that attempts to purposefully rid unwanted thoughts from mind can backfire, making them more likely 
                                to pop up than if you hadn’t tried to suppress them in the first place...Just try NOT to think about a white bear. Fortunately, some new research
                                 published a few months ago in the journal Psychological Science shows that there are ways to wipe our mental slates clean. And, most promising, 
                                 these techniques require neither a lot of time nor money — just a trash can. </p>

                            <h4>What Are The Final Thoughts On The Subject?</h4>
                            <p>In today’s day and age, we often think of the mind as a computer — the mind’s software running the body hardware; the software tells the hardware 
                                what to do. But this logic is wrong. The hardware, it turns out, has a big say in how the software functions. Our thoughts can be seen as material 
                                objects and treating them that way can change how we think and feel</p>
